## Hello ヾ(￣▽￣) 

I'm Riana, a full stack developer from Madagascar.

I love building tools that genuinely help people and make their lives easier. I also enjoy making small games in my free time! Most of my projects started as solutions to my own problems, which I'm now polishing and releasing for others to use.

### Tech Stack
I'm highly versatile and love learning new technologies. I work across the stack with:
- **Web:** React, JavaScript, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Django, 11ty
- **Backend/Data:** Python, SQL Server, Java
- **Game Dev:** GDScript (Godot), Lua, C#, learning C++/C, 
- **Low-level:** Currently exploring C, and C++ for systems programming and game engines

Also, I use vim btw 🤓

### 🌱 Currently
- Polishing personal projects for public release
- Developing games to kickstart a small studio
- Looking for opportunities to contribute to meaningful projects

### Outside of coding
I'm likely writing, learning something new, tinkering with electronics, or worldbuilding for stories/games.

Fun facts about me:
- I'm a cat maniac
- My favourite drink is water
- Chronic problem solver
